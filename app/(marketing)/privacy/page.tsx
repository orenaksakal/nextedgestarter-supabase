      </p>
      <p className="text-md p-2">
        3.2 Legal Compliance We may disclose your personal information if

        to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights
        or property, (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in
        connection with the Service, or (d) protect the personal safety of users
        of the Service or the public.
      </p>

        Data Security We take reasonable measures to protect the security of
        your personal information and prevent unauthorized access, use, or
        disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100%
        secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
        information.
      </p>
      <p className="text-md p-2">
        Data Retention We retain personal information for as long as necessary
        to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer
        retention period is required or permitted by law. When the information
        is no longer needed, we will securely dispose of it.

        Children's Privacy The Service is not intended for individuals under the
        age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from

        or services that are not controlled or operated by us. This Privacy
        Policy does not apply to such third-party websites or services, and we
        are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to
        review the privacy policies of those third parties.

        Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy
        Policy, we will notify you by posting the updated version on the Service
        or through other means. Your continued use of the Service after the
        effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance
        of the changes.
